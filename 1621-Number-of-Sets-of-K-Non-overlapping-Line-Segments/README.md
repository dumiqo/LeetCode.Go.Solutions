Given n points on a 1-D plane, where the ith point (from 0 to n-1) is at x = i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The k line segments do not have to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.

Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The two line segments can be: [0, 1] and [2, 3]; [0, 2] and [2, 3]; [0, 1] and [1, 3]; [0, 1] and [1, 2]; [1, 2] and [2, 3].

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The line segment can be [0, 1], [0, 2], or [1, 2].

Example 3:

Input: n = 30, k = 7
Output: 796297179

 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 1000
1 <= k <= n-1
